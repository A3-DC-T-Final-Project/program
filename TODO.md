TODO::
- Voltage scaling
  - Keep a state variable for which range the voltage is on
  - Then just use that variable in the map function to adjust the range
- Change mapping function to work with some linear regression
- Mode selection
  - 1 digital pin needed to select for current or voltage
    - Technically 2 pins but for now 1 pin will be grounded
  - 2 digital pins needed for selecting voltage range
  - 2 digital pins needed for selecting current range
- AC voltage mode
  - Either:
    - 'Ghost select' for AC voltage - handling will be done through software
	- Have a general voltage mode which measures both DC and AC
  - Take measurement for a small amount of time eg. 0.5s then take rms value
